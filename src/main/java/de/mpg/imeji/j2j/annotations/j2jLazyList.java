/**
 * For persistence of {@link List} in {@link Jena}. <br/>
 * - A lazy {@link List} should be defined for all {@link List} which might get huge. To avoid some
 * READ or WRITE operations to last too long, it is preferable to avoid such lists<br/>
 * - Lazy {@link List} must be used with caution, since they are skipped by certain operations<br/>
 * <br/>
 * - Example: {@link List} of Item in a Collection are defined as {@link LazyList}. When loading a
 * collection, j2j doesn't load the complete Collection {@link Resource}, the Item {@link List} is
 * not loaded. To get the item, a search is made (much faster that loading)
